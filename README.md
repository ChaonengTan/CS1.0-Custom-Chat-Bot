This is a assignment-classed chat bot probram that responds to inputted moods ie. happy, sad, exited.
Inputted moods are not only restricted to single word phrases but also sentences. 
This program is not equipped with a function to detect "not" [mood], Thank you for your understanding!
The inputted modd is evaluated and the response is given out via terminal.
Thankyou for your time... Because this program probably isnt worth it!
